1. What is "conditional rendering"?
    Conditional rendering allows us to render specific elements
    that follow a condition. 


2. When would you use &&?
    You would want to use the && operator when you want to display one thing or just not display it at all. 



3. When would you use a ternary?
You would use a ternary if you want to render either one of two options. 


4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?
   You can continue nesting, however, I think it is best to resort to a regular if-else or switch statement.
